# Instructions

Currently everything comes as a single tar.bal, which contains:
1. Scripts, which require [FlexNeuart](https://github.com/oaqa/FlexNeuART)
2. Queries generated using LLMs.
3. Training data produced with and without consistency checking.
We currently do not have bandwidth to provide a generic detailed description, we would be happy to address any specific questions about the code/scripts, generated data, etc.
